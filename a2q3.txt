loc represents a roon. By going through a for loop that loops through the 'trip' we take either N,S,W,E depending on the step taken in 'trip' and
assign loc to be value of the key 's' with 's' being N or S or W Or E (NSWE). Because the value of NSWE is another room,this line (96) "moves" the
replay through the game as it was played. Basically this line is akin to opening the door to another room and walking though.
